# Decentralized Realities

"At first, I was quietly immersed. Then, I felt a tear well up, blurring the view. Then I was choking back sounds as my wife was next to me reading a book, not realizing I was feeling so overwhelmed. I was a person in a messy apartment in New Jersey, with a virtual reality headset on my weeping face, far removed from Jordan, or Syria." Donning Gear VR (a virtual realy head-mounted display), Scott Stein, writer at CNet, explained his experience being immersed in the "Clouds over Sidra" demo. It's a virtual reality experience that follows a quick walk through the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan for displaced Syrians.

When we look at these experiences, we can see them as as culmination of decades of building immersive & escapist experiences. From film to games and now, the ultime immersion: virtual reality. It's a space where people are brought to tears: not just from empathising with Syrian refugees but also marvelling at the beauty of a space station in "Elite: Dangerous". To some extent, you can argue that the rise of these momentary "alternate spaces" has had a positive effect on humanity. It is seen as escapism, but it also has another edge to it... that of creating a meme that we should look at reality, and modify it to fit with the alternate worlds we were a part of. People have been inspired by the sci-fi technolgy in Star Trek. People have learned on how to conduct a community by being a guild leader in World of Warcaft. Each time, these other worlds where memes cultivate, finds it way back to reality. However, these alternate realities, have only been exactly that: alternate ones. It is always tangential to our current reality. I remember being amazed by Eve: Online, a complex MMO where you can be anything: a space trader dealing in commodities trading, or a backstabbing mercenary sent to infiltrate a rival corporation. I would start playing it, and I really enjoyed it, until I realised... the only way I could fully enjoy this experience is if this was my only life. To understand the complexity of it, and to engage fully in it, would mean I had to perform trade-offs. Wouldn't it be grand, I thought, if that could legitimately be your well-being? I could drop out of high-school and become a leader of a grand galactic space corporation.

You still had to some real-life job, and that was what we accepted. In some circumstances, these alternate realities could become our livelihoods. Second Life has a legitimate way to trade the virtual currency in & out of the virtual world. You can build objects for other people to use, own land and rent it out, all earning Linden Dollars, which has a market-based exchange rate. However, it became increasingly restrictive (for fear of money laundering), and for the most part was basically restricted to affluent countries. However, these alternate economies, by virtue of some loopholes (game time is sold as virtual items in the game) accrue a valuation. Early 2014, it was estimated that the Eve: Online universe was worth $18 million. In this regard, you can see that to make this your livelihood is restrictive and propably the domain of very few.

The blockchain can help bring forth these alternate realities as legitimate avenues to "live" in several ways. Using a combination of decentralized finance, property, trade, organisations, artificial intelligence and law, it not only creates a decentralized basis for our current reality, but any other one.

## Digital Money

((Section on Bitcoin as not just state-less money, but reality-less money. A MMO could have just Bitcoin. Segway into issues (still somewhat centralized). Segway into fully decentralized realities)

## Blockchains as Reality Mediators

((Combination of smart contracts + way to create decentralized consensus of A reality. Store world coordinates, use money, virtual defensible property rights etc. Virtual Reality as well as augmented reality. Experiment with EVERYTHING. Everything is opt out. Any reality can be tried.))

## IRL

((Effect on real life. Massive cascading effects. Mention Balaji's comments about cloud countries. Mention Neal Stephenson Phyles))
