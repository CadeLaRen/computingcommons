# Decentralized Realities

"At first, I was quietly immersed. Then, I felt a tear well up, blurring the view. Then I was choking back sounds as my wife was next to me reading a book, not realizing I was feeling so overwhelmed. I was a person in a messy apartment in New Jersey, with a virtual reality headset on my weeping face, far removed from Jordan, or Syria." Donning Gear VR (a virtual realy head-mounted display), Scott Stein, writer at CNet, explained his experience being immersed in the "Clouds over Sidra" demo. It's a virtual reality experience that follows a quick walk through the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan for displaced Syrians.

When we look at these experiences, we can see them as as culmination of decades of building immersive & escapist experiences. From film to games and now, the ultime immersion: virtual reality. It's a space where people are brought to tears: not just from empathising with Syrian refugees but also marvelling at the beauty of a space station in "Elite: Dangerous". To some extent, you can argue that the rise of these momentary "alternate spaces" has had a positive effect on humanity. It is seen as escapism, but it also has another edge to it... that of creating a meme that we should look at reality, and modify it to fit with the alternate worlds we were a part of. People have been inspired by the sci-fi technolgy in Star Trek. People have learned on how to conduct a community by being a guild leader in World of Warcaft. Each time, these other worlds where memes cultivate, finds it way back to reality. However, these alternate realities, have only been exactly that: alternate ones. It is always tangential to our current reality. I remember being amazed by Eve: Online, a complex MMO where you can be anything: a space trader dealing in commodities trading, or a backstabbing mercenary sent to infiltrate a rival corporation. I would start playing it, and I really enjoyed it, until I realised... the only way I could fully enjoy this experience is if this was my only life. To understand the complexity of it, and to engage fully in it, would mean I had to perform trade-offs. Wouldn't it be grand, I thought, if that could legitimately be your well-being? I could drop out of high-school and become a leader of a grand galactic space corporation.

You still had to some real-life job, and that was what we accepted. In some circumstances, these alternate realities could become our livelihoods. Second Life has a legitimate way to trade the virtual currency in & out of the virtual world. You can build objects for other people to use, own land and rent it out, all earning Linden Dollars, which has a market-based exchange rate. However, it became increasingly restrictive (for fear of money laundering), and for the most part was basically restricted to affluent countries. However, these alternate economies, by virtue of some loopholes (game time is sold as virtual items in the game) accrue a valuation. Early 2014, it was estimated that the Eve: Online universe was worth $18 million. In this regard, you can see that to make this your livelihood is restrictive and propably the domain of very few.

The blockchain can help bring forth these alternate realities as legitimate avenues to "live" in several ways. Using a combination of decentralized finance, property, trade, organisations, artificial intelligence and law, it not only creates a decentralized basis for our current reality, but any other one.

## Digital Money

The first, important way in which Bitcoin can influence alternate realities is by using it as a currency in those realities. By name, "digital" is both usable in the physical world as well is in the "virtual". With Bitcoin, its value as a currency exists both in the real world and in any virtual world. You can send money to others in this ledger through your phone when paying a merchant as equally you could if you pay an NPC for his new mail hauberk. It gets interesting on several levels. The first if you just simply replace a virtual world's currency for it. This means that the developer is no longer in control of monetary supply, but it means you can earn BTC from within the game. You challenge another player to a duel and if you both believe that the world creator (the developer) is a responsible mediator (that you both can trust), you can easily wager on these. If you are good, you can earn your keep, and within 5 minutes pop down to a corner and spend that exact same amount of Bitcoin you just earned buying yourself a nice juicy pie and some soda.

This however assumes a relatively normal game world that is not based on the premise that its currency is portable into the real world. When that is a given, different dynamics start to change. You could think in the vain of Project Entropia or Second Life, where you could money generating businesses & property. As a developer of the game, you could build new areas and sell them at auction to players which in turn can rent them out and sell wares from these stores. If you want, as a world developer, you could even consider that in order to play the game, each transaction within the game (from an internal wallet) has a small fee (world tax), that goes towards more development and server costs.

The issue with this setup though is that it is only the money that is tracked by the game, nothing else. As a player in this alternate world, you are beholden to the game and its intricacies to properly mediate the experience. If there is a bug or an exploit, it can be a pretty serious issue. There is no way for the company to reimburse you if you lost due to a bad connection. The options for repudiation is little, since the money is not. In some cases, the world developer might even be unrecognisably nefarious: purposefully creating negligible glitches in their favour.

However, we know that we can property management, organizations, law and so forth in a decentralized manner. It is possible to start going into a deeper rabbit hole: creating a whole reality that is decentralized. There is no middle-man anywhere.

## Blockchains as Reality Mediators

((Combination of smart contracts + way to create decentralized consensus of A reality. Store world coordinates, use money, virtual defensible property rights etc. Virtual Reality as well as augmented reality. Experiment with EVERYTHING. Everything is opt out. Any reality can be tried.))

## IRL

((Effect on real life. Massive cascading effects. Mention Balaji's comments about cloud countries. Mention Neal Stephenson Phyles))
