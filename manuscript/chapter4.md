# Decentralized & Distributed Organisations

When Instagram was sold to Facebook in April 2012, they created $1 billion of value in less than 2 years (from October 2010), and they only had a team of 13 people. With costs of technology going down, and access to global markets increase, each person's capability to enact change and create immense wealth grows dramatically. I was always wondering when we would see the first, 1 person, $1 billion company... until renowned venture capital Balaji Srinivasan claimed that the first zero person company already existed: Bitcoin. Once set up and launched, its existence required no one to run it anymore. The protocol creates constrained internal capital ("bitcoin") that quantifies the usefulness of the network. Its "employees" are similar to app developers: bootstrapping off a platform to create value for themselves The internal capital simultaneously functions as its token to be able to engage with the product (the Bitcoin network and blockchain). To use a real-world example: imagine that you could only buy Apple products with Apple shares. It's the combination of the token of value, and the token of use that means Bitcoin was (arguably) the first decentralized organisation.

Using the blockchain, completely new forms of organisations can emerge.

## Decentralized vs Distributed

When I researched the consensus on the terminology it seems there weren't any. The concepts are similar, however the way it is described and the potential implications of each one is different. It various based on people's ideas of what distributed, decentralized or autonomous means. I will attempt to detail what the blockchain introduces in terms of how we organise, and then delve into how people have to decided to label it, and then ending off with what I would regard to be the best terminology.

## Rethinking Organisations

A (very simplified) description of organisation is 'an entity that has a collective goal and is linked to an external environment' (thanks Wikipedia). Through collaboration, the sum becomes greater than the parts towards reach a specific goal. An organsation can be simple, such as a local society or a government. In different jurisdctions, a company or corporation is basically the same thing (for scope of this book), and essentially a variation of an organisation that is a legal person and has additional legislative rights that are granted to it.

Traditionally, organisations, if they wanted to enact change, they would require some legal and institutional aid. For example, if you want to accept other people's money as investment (as profit or non-profit), you should be incorporated. If you want a bank account, you have to be incorporated in a legal juridsction. If you want to have shares in a company, you'll require the strength of the legal system to enfore it, and so forth. At almost every step of the way, you'll want some kind of legal aid (even for something like a fraternal organisation for contract law). This is fine, and not inherently bad, and in some jurisdictions it is regarded as necessary administration to afford these aids. In other cases, there might be plenty of red tape and bureacracy to make this happen, but people still go through it if their desire is big enough, since there is no alternative.

The blockchain helps with organising in a few ways. The first is that it becomes to possible to build and secure the internal processes of an organisation that was usually the domain of a state to enforce. As described in chapter 2, it is possible to verifiably issue something that resembles shares without legal requirements. This means you already have the possibility to create an organisation that natively spans the globe. It's not a hub & spoke multi-national. It's a distributed supra-national organisation. Technically, there needs to be no restriction on who gets to invest. While there is a "interest in the public safety" argument against each company doing an IPO at initiation, this is possible with the blockchain. It is difficult to justify the effort to allow someone to invest $1 into your company, and in some cases it is not even allowed.

The second step revolves around using the blockchain to bake in business processes. A lot of our business processes are already digital, and most of it can be put into a blockhain. The reasons why you would do this, is as follows: 1) you have a trail of history. A blockchain contains a trace of how its information has changed since inception. And secondly, there is value in having unforgeable chain of events that can't be easily reversed. This might not make sense in terms of using a fully public blockchain like Bitcoin, since it will be expensive and not entirely useful to run several business processes over it. However, the design of a blockchain can be changed to have these beneficial features. Companies such as Eris Industries, which I will touch upon later, helps with regards to this.

Spawning from capturing business processes through smart contracts on a blockchain, you can additionally capture the transaction trail as well (as detailed in Chapter 1). Combining all these parts, creates a new framework for managing organisations that has decent enough clout to not require access to jurisdictional support. It's not saying that jurisdictional support is useful, but it does make it possible to bootstrap natural world-wide organisations, or even start local organisations. It can either be fully supra-national, or it could use some of the automated features & security that a blockchain provides.

--OLD STUFF. To be refactored--

There are 3 parts to this: Decentralized, Autonomous & Organization. They each point to a certain facet of the system that lends itself to being a totally new form of how organise. We already have decentralized systems: the most known is something like the torrent, p2p filesharing system. The important to realise is that a decentralized system has no locus of control. There is no center. The system by talking and interacting with its peers. It doesn't need to first "talk" to the hub or head of a system. A distributed system on the other hand, is very similar, however, the one key difference is that it relies on having a central part to it. For example, a spoke requires a hub, to exist. However, the spoke is relatively autonomous on its own (also like a province to a state). If the hub goes down, it can't function. However, with a decentralized system, it only has local information. When you combine all local information together, it forms an emergent whole. You can have your own Bitcoin in your private network, but once you start communication outside of it, it suddenly re-organizes to match to the consensus of the whole system (based on the protocol). In a distributed system, although it has some center, it is not centralized (which is the other extreme). "Spokes" can safely disappear. I'll give more examples later on.

Autonomy in this case represents a state where when the system has been set up, it doesn't require human involvement to deliver its services. Of course, anything that runs today, requires humans at some point. We have to generate electricity for computers to run in order to secure Bitcoin (for example). The term "human involvement" here represents the requirement of any human at that substrate. Bitcoin requires miners, which is set up by humans, but anything after the level of Bitcoin itself doesn't require a human. There's no auxillary processes required. Compared to a traditional organization, you always need a human somewhere, even in a pure software business. Someone needs a credit card to pay for things, or to write the books of the company.

The final part, the "organization" is essentially the newest part (when combined). The reason why this is new that Bitcoin, as a decentralized & autonomous systems, also has internal capital. This creates incentive for people to join essentially as employees, working to improve it, in order to benefit from the internal capital becoming more useful. In the organized chaos, like a swarm of birds, pulling in seemingly arbitrary directions, each individual imposes its goal on the system. Affecting the birds around them, the will of the system gets rippled through and eventually an emergent narrative, goal and theme emerges: typifying the idea of an organization. Although chaotic, the flock, seemingly as one, does head where it will go.

My defintions aren't supposed to taken as the definitive ones. Others have helped to shape this.

## Tenets

David Johnston wrote down the following tenets which explains the separate parts more clearly.

((insert his writing here))

Stan Larimer from Invictus Innovations [describes a DAC's](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics/#.UpKv78Ssi-2) (corporation, not organization) features as follows:

"They are corporations – they are free and independent persons (but don't have legal personality).  
They are autonomous – once up to speed, they no longer need (or heed) their creators.  
They are distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.  
They are transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all.  
They are confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.  
They are trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.  
They are fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders' interests.  
They are self-regulating – they robotically obey their own rules.  
They are incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.  
They are sovereign – over their digital resources (but don't have legal capacity)."

## Appcoins

((Check who popularised this term. Was it Naval Ravikant?))

An "appcoin" is a specific form of DAO where the token is explicitly used to consume the service it provides. The rules of the blockchain specify narrowly what the token can be redeemed for. They might not necessarily confer voting rights. More often that not, appcoins are used in DAOs where an internal record is required to keep track, because as is the case with Bitcoin, the token acts as spam control and as the exchange token. While Bitcoin can be classified as an appcoin, it is usually a name given to blockchain DAOs that focus on non-currency related projects (the focus on being an "app"). These are things such as Counterparty (which specialises in the issuance of tokens), or Factom (which spesialises in being a notary layer).

## Non-token DAOs

## Why DAOs?

## Bootstrapping DAOs

## Changing DAOs

The interesting thing about DAOs, is that ownership is a lot more fluid. If it is imagined as a "company", then it allows for people to invest any stage they wish, and with any kind of risk they wish. At any stage during Bitcoin's lifecycle, you could've bought any amount you wish. It's as if when the project was created, it had an IPO. It allows non-accredited investors to take part in a project's success much earlier than with normal companies. From a consumer protection side, it does mean that scams could exist, however a lot of worries about it can be mitigated because the project's code is often open-source, and the tokens itself cannot be faked or forged (unlike in the past when share certificates could be faked).

Since, once a DAO is set up, it should be able to run continue in its current direction without human involvement, it is sometimes required (in the case of a problem), or wished (in the case of a desired improvement) to change it. Once this change is implemented, it continues along its "autonomous" path. For DAOs in which the token does not represent any voting rights, the direction it changes to is indirectly voted on by the participants who are tasked with keeping the blockchain alive. In Bitcoin's case, the miners always have the veto rights. If they believe Bitcoin is headed for ruin and don't want to adopt a measure put forth by the community, the community can't do anything about it. However, it is self-regulating check: because if the miners don't follow the community's wishes, it might reduce their reputation, clout and financial reward. For example: a short while, when Bitcoin's first halving occurred at the end of 2012, there was discussion amongst some participants to not reduce the reward (which luckily didn't happen). This sort of change is more akin to "survival of the fittest". Both variants are out there in the wild. If there isn't consensus before the change is implemented, there could easily be 2 variants running side by side as participants fight to let a certain side win. Although this could happen, the fact that such conflict exists in the first place is not very welcoming and reduces confidence in the project. It is usually avoided at all costs, such than when a change is required, a relatively large community based consensus is reached. It is important to note here, that in this case, all communication happens "off-chain": it is not done through the blockchain itself. People discuss this on Github, forums, email, chatrooms, etc.

For some DAOs, the token used in the system will either only provide voting rights or it could be used for the services & voting rights (combined). The idea is such that using these voting rights, parts of the automated procedures can be replaced with new functionality. For example, take a very simple DAO. If you spend the token, the DAO tells you a joke. The owners (those who hold tokens), feels they want to add more services to the DAO, and thus vote to add a new feature: insults. The contract is then added as a service automatically, and after that is done, the DAO continues onwards automatically as it had before. If you want a joke or an insult, you have to acquire the token and spend it. On more complex levels, you can have DAOs that, for example, own a fleet of self-driving cars. The cars obey the rules of the DAO. If they want to roll out the cars to new areas, the users of the DAO vote to allow these new rules.

rough list to cover: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tenets of DAOS, Appcoins, Eris, Doug, CPDAOs, "Deodands" (as intro to AI chapter).
