# Decentralized Autonomous Organisations

When Instagram was sold to Facebook in April 2012, they created $1 billion of value in less than 2 years (from October 2010), and they only had a team of 13 people. With costs of technology going down, and access to global markets increase, each person's capability to enact change and create immense wealth grows dramatically. I was always wondering when we would see the first, 1 person, $1 billion company... until renowned venture capital Balaji Srinivasan claimed that the first zero person company already existed: Bitcoin. Once set up and launched, its existence required no one to run it anymore. The protocol creates constrained internal capital ("bitcoin") that quantifies the usefulness of the network. The internal capital simultaneously functions as its token to be able to engage with the product (the Bitcoin network and blockchain). To use a real-world example: imagine that you could only buy Apple products with Apple shares. It's the combination of the token of value, and the token of use that means Bitcoin was the first decentralized autonomous organisation.

## Tenets

There are various ways to describe this phenomenon. Some decide to use other suffixes such as "corporations" or "companies". At the end of the day, it amounts to the same core design: it's a decentralized system that has internal capital which is represented through a specific token that is tied to the service it provides through the protocol. David Johnston wrote down the following tenets which explains the separate parts more clearly.

Stan Larimer from Invictus Innovations [describes a DAC's](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics/#.UpKv78Ssi-2) (corporation, not organization) features as follows:

"They are corporations – they are free and independent persons (but don't have legal personality).  
They are autonomous – once up to speed, they no longer need (or heed) their creators.  
They are distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.  
They are transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all.  
They are confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.  
They are trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.  
They are fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders' interests.  
They are self-regulating – they robotically obey their own rules.  
They are incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.  
They are sovereign – over their digital resources (but don't have legal capacity)."

## Bootstrapping DAOs

## Changing DAOs

The interesting thing about DAOs, is that ownership is a lot more fluid. If it is imagined as a "company", then it allows for people to invest any stage they wish, and with any kind of risk they wish. At any stage during Bitcoin's lifecycle, you could've bought any amount you wish. It's as if when the project was created, it had an IPO. It allows non-accredited investors to take part in a project's success much earlier than with normal companies. From a consumer protection side, it does mean that scams could exist, however a lot of worries about it can be mitigated because the project's code is often open-source, and the tokens itself cannot be faked or forged (unlike in the past when share certificates could be faked).

rough list to cover: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tenets of DAOS, Appcoins, Eris, Doug, CPDAOs, "Deodands" (as intro to AI chapter).
