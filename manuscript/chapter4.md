# Decentralized Autonomous Organisations

When Instagram was sold to Facebook in ((date)), they created $1 billion of value in ((x)) years, and they only had a team of ((y)). With costs of technology going down, and access to global markets increase, each person's capability to enact change and create immense wealth grows dramatically. I was always wondering when we would see the first, 1 person, $1 billion company... until renowned venture capital Balaji Srinivasan ((sp?)) claimed that the first zero person company already existed: Bitcoin. Once set up and launched, its existence required no one to run it anymore. The protocol create constrained internal capital ("bitcoin") that quantifies the useful of the network. The internal capital simultaneously functions as its token to be able to engage with the product (the Bitcoin network and blockchain). To use a real-world example: imagine that you could only buy Apple products with Apple shares. It's the combination of the token of value, and the token of use that means Bitcoin was the first decentralized autonomous organisation.

## Tenets

There are various ways to describe this phenomenon. Some decide to use other suffixes such as "corporations" or "companies". At the end of the day, it amounts to the same core design: it's a decentralized system that has internal capital which is represented through a specific token that is tied to the service it provides through the protocol. David Johnston wrote down the following tenets which explains the separate parts more clearly.

## Bootstrapping DAOs

## Changing DAOs

The interesting thing about DAOs, is that ownership is a lot more fluid. If it is imagined as a "company", then it allows for people to invest any stage they wish, and with any kind of risk they wish. At any stage during Bitcoin's lifecycle, you could've bought any amount you wish. It's as if when the project was created, it had an IPO. It allows non-accredited investors to take part in a project's success much earlier than with normal companies. From a consumer protection side, it does mean that scams could exist, however a lot of worries about it can be mitigated because the project's code is often open-source, and the tokens itself cannot be faked or forged (unlike in the past when share certificates could be faked).

rough list to cover: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tenets of DAOS, Appcoins, Eris, Doug, CPDAOs, "Deodands" (as intro to AI chapter).
