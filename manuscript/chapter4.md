# Decentralized Autonomous Organisations

When Instagram was sold to Facebook in April 2012, they created $1 billion of value in less than 2 years (from October 2010), and they only had a team of 13 people. With costs of technology going down, and access to global markets increase, each person's capability to enact change and create immense wealth grows dramatically. I was always wondering when we would see the first, 1 person, $1 billion company... until renowned venture capital Balaji Srinivasan claimed that the first zero person company already existed: Bitcoin. Once set up and launched, its existence required no one to run it anymore. The protocol creates constrained internal capital ("bitcoin") that quantifies the usefulness of the network. Its "employees" are similar to app developers: bootstrapping off a platform to create value for themselves The internal capital simultaneously functions as its token to be able to engage with the product (the Bitcoin network and blockchain). To use a real-world example: imagine that you could only buy Apple products with Apple shares. It's the combination of the token of value, and the token of use that means Bitcoin was (arguably) the first decentralized autonomous organisation (DAO).

There are various ways in which you can define what a DAO requires in order to be called a DAO. Different individuals and companies have different ideas on how it extends from its core. However, what underlies all the definitions is that ownership and control is managed in a distributed manner (usually through blockchain technology). This core is governed by codified rules and like normal organizations form around a common purpose.

This field is quite nascent and new experiments have started being produced to build these new styles of organizations.

## Tenets

Some decide to use other suffixes such as "corporations" or "companies". The definitions start differing when you start plotting the extent of human involvement required in a DAO, and how much of a DAO's functions happen through it, rather than through other channels. On one spectrum you can have a fully automated, self-adapting DAO in which human involvement only extends in its desire to want the internal capital to be able to use it. Humans have no interactions or ways to influence its functions or rules. The closest DAO to this is Bitcoin itself, although it is still somewhat removed from this extreme. Humans are still required to update it (if problems occur). On the other spectrum, the most minimal DAO is simply an organisation in which ownership is recorded and transferred in a distributed manner. The business processes and the services it sells are external. For example, to be a part of a secret fraternity, you only need to show that you own a part of it. The most powerful idea of a DAO on this spectrum is to build in processes that extend from the distributed ownership structure. In other words, for the secret fraternity, having a part of the owernship entails to automatically opening a secret door (a trivial, small example). The easier it can extend from code to producing services without requiring too much human involvement is an exciting idea. An example in the middle of this spectrum is a DAO which has these functionalities (code that automatically delivers services), but humans (or those who own it), can vote to change these functionalities (replacing the automated code with other automated code so to speak). 

David Johnston wrote down the following tenets which explains the separate parts more clearly.

((insert his writing here))

Stan Larimer from Invictus Innovations [describes a DAC's](http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics/#.UpKv78Ssi-2) (corporation, not organization) features as follows:

"They are corporations – they are free and independent persons (but don't have legal personality).  
They are autonomous – once up to speed, they no longer need (or heed) their creators.  
They are distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.  
They are transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all.  
They are confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.  
They are trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.  
They are fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders' interests.  
They are self-regulating – they robotically obey their own rules.  
They are incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.  
They are sovereign – over their digital resources (but don't have legal capacity)."

## Bootstrapping DAOs

## Changing DAOs

The interesting thing about DAOs, is that ownership is a lot more fluid. If it is imagined as a "company", then it allows for people to invest any stage they wish, and with any kind of risk they wish. At any stage during Bitcoin's lifecycle, you could've bought any amount you wish. It's as if when the project was created, it had an IPO. It allows non-accredited investors to take part in a project's success much earlier than with normal companies. From a consumer protection side, it does mean that scams could exist, however a lot of worries about it can be mitigated because the project's code is often open-source, and the tokens itself cannot be faked or forged (unlike in the past when share certificates could be faked).

rough list to cover: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tenets of DAOS, Appcoins, Eris, Doug, CPDAOs, "Deodands" (as intro to AI chapter).
