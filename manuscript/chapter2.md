# Decentralized Property

When we usually look property rights (in the form of real estate), we rely on two systems to make it work. The first is the proper record-keeping tools ("who owns what"), and the second is the enforcement of those rights. In the developed world, it's usually taken for granted that the records are good enough that you don't really that you could be buying a title deed with your life's work and realise the next day that you bought a piece of worthless paper. Additionally, when disputes arise, that the state helps to enforce this, by the usual agreement of: "I'll pay taxes if I can call on you to get invaders off my lawn."

State enforcement of property rights might be working fine, but there are cases in the world where proper record-keeping of ownership is poor. Having a blockchain-based system could mean that you could potentially repurpose it for use in various "ownership verticals": from basic things such as private and public equity to land registries. [Antonis Polemitis crowdsourced a list](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2014/3/11/bitcoin-series-24-the-mega-master-blockchain-list) from Twitter of potential uses for the blockchain (in terms of its use a distributed, public registry) and it's more than 84 possibilities. 1 of these 84 possibilities is currency: dubbed the "first app" of the blockchain. The possibilities for it to keep track (or "keep state") of almost everything makes you suddenly question a lot of the current record-keeping systems we have. The use of the blockchain to keep track of the owernship of various items, is called "smart property".

## Equity

Leading onwards from decentralized finance, the first obvious use case, is to use the blockchain to keep track of ownership in an entity: shares or equity if you will. Several technology platforms have blossomed in 2013/2014 that uses Bitcoin (and other blockchains) as the base layer: such as Open Assets, Counterparty, Mastercoin, NXT, Horizon & BitShares. The meta-layers such as Counterparty (often called "Bitcoin 2.0") works by using addresses to store additional information in them. In a rudimentary metaphor (coming back to our lovable post-office box), it is like being able to store other things besides mail in it ((perhaps not the best metaphor)).

There are various reasons why you would want to do it this way: 1) instantly, mathematically secure, 2) public and immediately auditable and perhaps the most important part, 3) the exchange and dividend payments is done both with and [on top of the platform it is run](https://gendal.wordpress.com/2014/10/05/cryptocurrency-products-and-services-will-determine-adoption-of-the-currency-not-the-other-way-round/). It also means, just like with how Bitcoin allows people access to a currency with only the internet, people can mint provably secure shares and equity in their company or venture, make it available to any investor in the world within seconds. This is of course, right now, in such a legally grey area, because what is essentially happening is a public offering. It's arguable that the regulation invented to prevent people form just arbitrarily creating public offers for investment becomes less and less required due to the fact that you extremely secure, decentralized stock units & you can do additional auditing such as proof-of-reserves.

To trade on these platforms, Counterparty, for example allows the existence of a decentralized exchange as well: users can exchange Bitcoin or other assets like a normal exchange, except there is no custodial control (such as with normal Bitcoin exchanges) since fiat currencies aren't used.

## Super Tokens ((think of a better name))

There are legal loopholes (which is still somewhat up in the air), where companies have minted tokens, but instead of it acting like the usual share, it enables additional actions within an eco-system instead. So, it is creating a scarce resource which you require in order to interact with a system. For example, the LetsTalkBitcoin media network, created LTBCoin, which is the only currency used to pay for ads on the network. Additionally, they provide additional incentives for the token holders. These include a unique distribution mechanism (essentially given to the users of the LTB network), and things like token-controlled access (you can only get access to a forum if you hold some LTBCoin). As can be seen, because these tokens are similarly programmable and represent ownership of a certain community, you can empower token holders with various features unique to that community.

Another example of a unique uses of a token system, is a game called "Spells of Genesis". The game has essentially 2 tokens that are used for resources: one is external (and the other internal to the game). The external token is the blockchain token, minted with something like Counterparty. In "Spells of Genesis", it is called "mines", to emphasise its use in the game world. Mine tokens generate gems, which in turn is a consumable used to do various things in the game (eg, getting an enhancement for combat). Users who play the game can buy gems (like any in-app purchase in games). When they do, users who also hold mines, gets rewarded with gems as well. So, you can either just buy gems each time, or hold mines to generate gems for you. If you think about it in terms of a venn diagram, the mine token is external, living on the blockchain and its use intersects into the game world: generating gems. Mines float like any asset: it can be bought or sold. If you think the game is good and will get very popular, you might even want to speculate and buy up some mines to make a real-world profit (not a profit in game). It's really clever, because if the game is popular, more gems get produced, which is also a good "return on investment" if you are invested in playing the game itself. It is like "dividends", but you get internal tokens to a game world, not Bitcoin or any other form of money. There's definitely several more use cases here that could be explored. What about a Reddit-like site, where votes gets distributed to holders of an external asset? The votes only have a use inside the ecosystem, not outside. It blurs the line between what is an asset and what we regard to be "value". Within any closed loop system, you can design this type of model.
