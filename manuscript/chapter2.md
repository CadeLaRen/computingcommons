# Decentralized Property

When we usually look property rights (in the form of real estate), we rely on two systems to make it work. The first is the proper record-keeping tools ("who owns what"), and the second is the enforcement of those rights. In the developed world, it's usually taken for granted that the records are good enough that you don't really that you could be buying a title deed with your life's work and realise the next day that you bought a piece of worthless paper. Additionally, when disputes arise, that the state helps to enforce this, by the usual agreement of: "I'll pay taxes if I can call on you to get invaders off my lawn."

State enforcement of property rights might be working fine, but there are cases in the world where proper record-keeping of ownership is poor.
