# Decentralized Property

When we usually look property rights (in the form of real estate), we rely on two systems to make it work. The first is the proper record-keeping tools ("who owns what"), and the second is the enforcement of those rights. In the developed world, it's usually taken for granted that the records are good enough that you don't really that you could be buying a title deed with your life's work and realise the next day that you bought a piece of worthless paper. Additionally, when disputes arise, that the state helps to enforce this, by the usual agreement of: "I'll pay taxes if I can call on you to get invaders off my lawn."

State enforcement of property rights might be working fine, but there are cases in the world where proper record-keeping of ownership is poor. Having a blockchain-based system could mean that you could potentially repurpose it for use in various "ownership verticals": from basic things such as private and public equity to land registries. [Antonis Polemitis crowdsourced a list](http://ledracapital.com/blog/2014/3/11/bitcoin-series-24-the-mega-master-blockchain-list) from Twitter of potential uses for the blockchain (in terms of its use a distributed, public registry) and it's more than 84 possibilities. 1 of these 84 possibilities is currency: dubbed the "first app" of the blockchain. The possibilities for it to keep track (or "keep state") of almost everything makes you suddenly question a lot of the current record-keeping systems we have. The use of the blockchain to keep track of the owernship of various items, is called "smart property".

## Equity

Leading onwards from decentralized finance, the first obvious use case, is to use the blockchain to keep track of ownership in an entity: shares or equity if you will. There are various reasons why you would want to do it this way: 1) instantly, mathematically secure, 2) public and immediately auditable and perhaps the most important part, 3) the exchange and dividend payments is done both with and on top on top of the platform is is run.
