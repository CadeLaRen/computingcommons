# Decentralized Trade

Trade without intermediaries works pretty well in small communities, because inherent trust exists. Take a small seaside town (the wonderfully quaint Infanta on the southern coast of South Africa). There's only 90 residents that live there. Each year our family used to go there for the holidays, and we got to know most of the people in the community. Due to some various issues, the family house was sold, but we still go each year, because it is such a great place. Because it is so small, houses are often rented to friends and family, and not really "outsiders". You won't really find the great spots to rent online. If you know the people, finding information in this market is not difficult. Once a place is found and agreed upon, transacting is also easy. There's no requirement for escrow or any such service. There's no fees. It might occur even with cash, and not even with bank accounts (less so these days with cash though). Payments are flexible as well: "Pay me sometime in January!", or even in some circumstances, a day's worth of rent is traded for 3 pieces of prime fish from the river. Exchange and trade is a lot more flexible if the market is small.

The larger the market becomes, the less inherent trust exists and thus it is usually shifted towards institutions that help with trade. It's a limit to our capacity to map strong relationships: mirroring anthropologist Robin Dunbar's famous number. Luckily, we've been able to create services and tools that allow us to function on greater levels of coordination. The larger the available market for trade becomes, the more noisy or impure terms affect trade. So services like EBay facilitate trade. They not only provide a platform to make sure information (buyers vs sellers) come together, but they also provide a very important additional part: they provide trust. In a small market, people are usually 1 (max 2 degrees) separated. With EBay, it achieves the same trust hop, because both participants that come through EBay seeing it as their 1 degree of separation. "Do you trust EBay? I do. Do you? Yes, I also trust EBay. Let's trade."

For their services: 1) minimizing market lag, 2) escrow and 3) trust, they charge a fee. For most participants they are usually happy with this, but on all 3 fronts, there's granularity that exists from the buyer and seller's side that is not met. What if a seller already has a buyer lined up, but in order to reap future benefits from the EBay, they are basically "forced" to sell through EBay in order to build up a reputation? What if the users don't want to use PayPal, and rather want to use Dogecoin? They enjoy the market making that EBay and enjoy the trust it brings, but they don't to use their payment options. What now? What if trust was established without using EBay as the trust hop (trust from Twitter & Facebook), but people still want to use the market making of EBay?

With newer services such as AirBNB, the trust component gets shifted towards the current established social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. It forms the basis of the rising "sharing economy". We can now trust others more, because having and maintaining a Facebook account is a proof of time investment. AirBNB as a brand still has a small trust factor, but more importantly they are market makers for home rentals, and facilitate trade and disputes.

At the end of the day if you are in the process of providing a platform for trade, you basically have to answer the following questions:

How well do I put buyers and sellers together?
How do I make sure the participants trust each other? (Helping to build reputation, or borrowing reputation)
How do I facilitate exchange? (Do I provide escrow? Dispute resolution?)
What are the fees I charge for my services?

## Silk Road

In February 2011, the "Silk Road" was launched.

Rough list to cover: Silk Road, "Small trade", OpenBazaar, Different trust schemes, Reputation (WOT + Proof of Burn), Programmable Trade. (DEXes?). "Proof of Service".
