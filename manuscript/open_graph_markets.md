Open Graph Markets

At the end of 2013, I had what felt like an epiphany. Influenced by the Dogecoin community and subsequent thoughts around why it came to exist in the 1st place, I thought that one day we would all have our own “currencies”. Dogecoin was a manifestation & quantification of a network around a silly meme. The thought pattern that followed was one where the next step would be: anyone, and anything that can garner a network will be quantified. Everyone will have a “personal stock” related to the network effect one has on the world.

Through this, it would seem that one can provide through unlocking wealth from networks that didn’t fit into the current organisational joint-stock corporation model. One could “invest” in a community. A town. A shop. A city. A person. A thing. A festival. Any and all networks. A million “currencies” will spring forth. Automating this beast involved ideas from having personal AI bots trading your stock depending on the influence you have on the world. If you frequented a coffee shop, it would make sense to also be invested in it.

Through only existing and the “information” one injects into all the network, one would accrue value. The more you did, and the larger your own network grew, the more wealth and influence you would have. Indirectly, this is the case as the world stands now, but it feels like value moves at the pre-Internet speed. One can’t just create stock in anything and they can’t be automatically traded on a global scale. Until now of course, thanks to blockchain tech (& Ethereum) in general.

However, as time went on, I kept thinking about it. I spoke to friends over beers about it. Read more. Listened more. Thought more. The core value of such a system, that springs forth from this is the feeling that we can create a world where what you are, what you do, what you know and what you enact more directly correlates to wealth.

Money as a proxy for “standing” in society worked pretty well until technology & the web completely changed it. Our most important contributions to society for a long while was our labour. And our labour was physically constrained by time & space and thus as a society it seemed okay that the money we earned and what it represented equated to our “standing” in society. If we assume that money is a way for us, as humans, to reduce social transaction costs then we also need to trust that money represents the ideals we share. Due to technological levers, we’ve removed the effort of creating knowable value. What one does might not be correlated anymore to what we feel they should be worth. Money was “good enough” for this, for a long time.

Thus technology is crippling our capability to value correctly what society produces. It’s why the “1%” has become an evil thing. We don’t feel they deserve it. Some of them do, but we’ve lost our ability to understand it. And due to our own inability to generate wealth as our grandparents did (for example) (due to technology), we feel frustrated.

Tangentially, we’ve become empowered as citizens like no other generation in history. We are witnessing a creative & communication explosion. We are amateur photographers on instagram. We tweet. We blog. We write. We contribute our thoughts with each other in a new global creative commons. Somehow… Just somehow, it would be great if we could eke out a beer from something like an instagram-like (for example).

What we feel is valuable to society doesn’t match up anymore with the idea of hours of labour = wealth. Money, the current legal system & traditional organisations all move too slow to adapt to what we feel should be valuable, and probably never will.

We are only at the cusp of this. We’ll continue to lose jobs, given to machines, and we’ll be left with figuring out how to live without it. Technology will increasingly make us capable of creating grand things and experience new ways to connect. The time from though stream to share is decreasing rapidly: painting a 3D sculpture in VR and seeing it 3D printed in an hour (for example).

We can weather through this change if we figure out how to value the contributions to society in new ways before we all lose our jobs, get angry at each other, and want to eviscerate each other.

Thus, since then, as more ideas came to me, I’ve toyed with different ways to do this. There was a complicated idea called DARIUS (Decentralised Autonomous Reinforcing Information Use System), which was a system of rewarding creators & curators through tokens of value. I had ideas of using time as a unit of account. All crazy ideas.

Recently, I’ve become enamoured with prediction markets and their promises. The idea is simple. You bet with the market on the outcome of events. Let’s say, you want to know what the market thinks will be the winner of the US presidential election. You pay 1$ and get 2 tokens. The winning outcome (Donald Trump, for example), will then be worth 1$. The other outcome worth 0. One can buy/sell these outcomes at various market rates. Thus, in a binary market like this, the value of the token is a direct proxy of the chance the market thinks something will happen. If Clinton token is worth 0.3, then you will make 0.7 if she wins. You then believe there’s a 30% chance she will win.

Essentially, one enables people who knows something about the world to make predictions about the future. If you think you know better than the market, you get a financial reward. Information, more directly correlates to getting a return. One doesn’t need to package or repurpose information. Some institutions like trend analytics companies love this, since they do all the effort and in order to make a return, they have to sell this information to others. Those who buy it, then hope to take this information and make a return from it, either changing company strategies or inventing new companies to meet potential new upcoming trends. Similarly, an avid soccer player (already playing bookies) could inject information about who will the next Premier League (will it be the Foxes again?). A mother who loves her reality TV music competitions can bet against other watchers about who will win the show.

Not only does one more directly allow people to create value for themselves, simply by knowing & understanding, it also results in “free” modelling of the future. The other name for prediction markets are “idea futures”. We all model the future for communal benefit.

Prediction markets are a powerful idea and have been used to design governance systems, such as a futarchy, where the markets bets on the success of proposed government policy.

An open platform to make predictions on would be a massive benefit to society. With platforms such as Augur & Gnosis on Ethereum we will see what this future looks like.

Thinking about blockchains & Ethereum, Maciej Olpinksi has written some excellent articles on graphs. The content that is being created in the world has substantially more impact depending on *where* it is. For example, Psy’s Gangnam Style has substantially more impact being ON YouTube than elsewhere. Similarly, our own standing in society is also depending on how we fit into a larger graph. We have links to everything. Maciej calls this the internet of ALL things. Our graphs don’t merely exist as social graphs anymore. We also extend our influence to content & places (for example). One of the edges is the the tweet I favourited. Another edge is the event I attended on Facebook. Another edge is a like on Instagram and so forth.

Putting these open graphs on a blockchain affords it the same open & permission-less innovation, that graphs haven’t seen before. Until now, graphs were solely owned by corporates: Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. They know how it has grown, how it has evolved and similarly run their own predictions on how this graph will grow into the future (see friend recommendations). For Facebook, their interest is in getting you to engage in their ecosystem and thus predictions center around keeping you there.

What if you combine prediction markets with graphs?

Introducing Open Graph Markets

The concept is simple: we allow actors to predict how the internet-of-all-things graph will evolve over time.

Several actors can influence the graph in various ways. One’s standing in society relates to our capability to influence this graph. For example, Elon Musk has several companies of employees connected to him, as well as the energy market and potentially the whole world. He has an influence on a large part of the whole graph.

By being able to influence the graph, a node in it can make predictions on the edges just before they occur, thus reaping economic benefit from it. In other words, simply by being and enacting one self upon the world, one could create wealth.

How exactly this Open Graph Market will work has to be sketched. There are various ways in which the graph itself needs to be stored and managed (perhaps on IPLD?), and various ways in which predictions can be done as well.

For example, could one predict simply how many in bound links a new node will generate (i.e., how many likes a new Taylor Swift video on YouTube will create)?

Is the weight of an edge important? Is a bi-directional edge important? Should there be a way to create prediction edges, which act as a way to buy attention from the node? In other words: “The market thinks you will like this photo or like this person”? What would the terms of the predictions be? Would a prediction edge have an expiry point? Who will be the market makers? Who will predict? Will Facebook, Google, et al, run their simulations on this open, permanent graph instead? In order to fully gather enough benefit from it, a personal AI bot might be employed to bet automatically for you. Should there be deposits on edge creations in order to avoid sybil attacks? Should edges have different types? How would liquidity work? Would liquidity follow already established nodes? Who will take the counter-bets? By definition, there should a counterparts predicting on ways in which the graph will NOT evolve. Maybe it should be that one predicts only *when* an edge connection will happen, not IF? Should one be able to influence edge creation through a market? Would this system allow, for example, a mother who is a simply a community creche caretaker to generate wealth? Would this mean that the unit of account we use to run these markets then more directly correlate to what we deem as valuable contributions to society? Perhaps a more fractal approach should be made? What if each edge had its own “stock”/“token”?

There are a myriad numbers of implementation questions & many assumptions. The first assumption is that we will see an implementation of an open graph and incentives to create it. We also assume that the current infrastructure, of the likes of Ethereum & IPFS/IPLD can support it. A graph like this could quickly grow to be incredibly large. And this idea might only really see the light of the day in 5 to 10 year’s time.

Assuming this general direction of being able to provide new agency to all people, what would the MVP look like?

A simple content curation service built on an open graph? Who knows?

What do you think of this idea? How do we make it happen? How is it good? How is it bad? How do we progress towards this? Is it farfetched?

Time to spread the idea to more minds, extend the graph of this concept itself. ;)
