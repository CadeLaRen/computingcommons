Something is afoot. You are, probably. You are either standing, sitting or lying down as you read this sentence. For those attempting to defy gravity, you might also be flying, hanging or just floating about.

In all these scenarios, there’s plenty of things taken for granted, for you to assume your chosen position. Standing on a floor. Sitting on a chair. Lying on a bed. Flying in a plane. Hanging from a bungee rope (for those times you just really want to read an article after you’ve flushed your body with adrenaline).

We trust the floor, chair, bed, plane & bungee rope (usually). We don’t generally question a chair’s capability to hold our weight. It’s no intervention at least. We have heuristics & an understanding of the world & its physics that allow to us to basically “forget” (from our perspective) those required internal mental processes.

It just works. This neat property of physics means we can build very tall buildings & float about in space stations. When we don’t have to trust the previous substrate to be obstreperous, we can generally assume that into the future things should be okay & we can build upon it.

From a social systems perspective, we’ve been building new foundations for aeons. We invent new systems that allow us to similarly “forget” the required internal mental processes to interact with each other. Everything we run to make the modern economy tick is built on things that were once new. Each time we invent a new substrate, we can forge ahead knowing we aren’t building on weak foundations: the chair isn’t made of paper.

Agriculture, Aqueducts, Steam Engines, Cars, Printing Presses, Double-entry accounting, Joint-stock Corporations, Cities & the Web. Countless inventions (big & small) that allowed us to push our social systems to grander scales.

Now we live in a globally connected world. Almost all adults have a smartphone ((check)) & products like Facebook have 1.55 billion monthly active users. It’s all unprecedented & we are moving further ahead. We are taking a new leap. We are globally connected, but we are still pretty much stuck with social systems from a pre-internet era. We are at the cusp of solidifying these grand new social systems of the new age. What new technology could take us further, allowing us to not just becoming a planetary society, but also eventually an interplanetary one?

If we take a look at history, and how we got here, it’s about continuously automating the internal social processes of society through technology. What would allow us to not rely on the crutches of national level systems: towards a society where we can trust others on a global scale? Or rather, where we don’t have to think if this chair is going to hold our weight? Where we don’t have to rely on figuring out if we can trust the chair or not? I can interact with anyone on Earth without having to rely on the mental processes to figure out if you aren’t going to abuse it.

Thankfully, there is such a technology that holds that promise: the blockchain. It ushers in the computing commons.

The Commons

Before explaining just what exactly the computing commons is, it would help to explain the context of why the commons initially disappeared, how we created capitalism and how the rebirth of a new commons are upon us. There's been a lot written about this. Jeremy Rifkin's excellent Zero Marginal Cost Society gives and great breakdown on this (where most of this summary has been borrowed from).

The "commons" has an interesting history. It is normally defined as "cultural & natural resources accessible to all members of society". "They are held in common, not owned privately". Yes, this definition was taken from one of humanity's greatest cultural common goods: Wikipedia itself. In other words, it is resources that does not discriminate on who is allowed access to it. Different definitions have different ways of defining what is a public vs common good. Mostly, a public good is accessible by anyone, but sometimes requires governance to keep it that way (for example, a park). A true common good, is something that is available without requirement to maintain it so: like air. While usable by all (non-rivalrous & non-exclusive), common goods are sometimes subjected to negative externalities that is difficult to police (such as pollution). A common-pool resource on the other hand are resources which are accessible by any, but which's usage can potentially exclude others from using it ((example)).

Academics discuss the different definitions and where you must draw the line between. The important part here is that ideologically, a good that is designed to not be private & and whose access has little to zero discrimination can be considered to move into the domain of the commons. Wikipedia's content is licensed under ((insert licence here)) and it's goal is that it be shared & be accessible by anyone. Whilst some of these common goods have barriers to entry: requiring a flight ticket visit Central Park or requiring a phone with internet access to get knowledge from Wikipedia, the important part is the intent. It is a good whose purpose is to be shared & accessible to all.

Historically, the commons simply referred to natural resouces such as land. The understanding of the world and our position shaped how it was viewed. Land was God's creation, and there existed the "great chain of Being": each part fulfilling their role in it. After the fall of the Roman empire, Europe split into many isolated localities ((confirml)). Feudal landlords leased their land to peasant farmers under tenancy agreements: you can harvest the lands in exchange that I get some of said harvest. Land was aggregated and common. There were no fences ((confirm)). While it seems like the lords owned the land, it's important to remember that according to the chain of Being, only God had dominion over the land, no person had absolute lordship. The lords simply accepted their responsibility: to manage the land.

Two trends led to the eventual closure of the commons. A rising population caused food prices to rise. This caused general inflation which caused problems for feudal lords as tenancy agreements were fixed at pre-inflationary prices (that lasted normally for 3 lifetimes). An incipient textile industry also started growing and thus it became more profitable for feudal lords to close off their lands and start farming sheep instead. This uprooted the peasants whose outcome resulted in them having to sell labour instead.

With growing enclosures, people exchanged lands simply on how trustworthy they were. To facilitate this common law was eventually invented to allow exchange of private property. Strangers were then given tools to exchange private property, knowing police & courts would enforce it.

Combined with inventions such as the windmill & printing press, it eventually gave rise to the beginnings of the market economy and reduction of feudal power. Windmills using wind, could produce benefits from using the air (not able to claimed upon by the lord) & the printing press allowed commoners to exchange with each by allowing stored memory & written contracts. The first so-called "free cities" sprung up where the commoners were empowered enough to compete with feudal jurisdictions. Interestingly, it was said that if a serf could escape to a free city and remain there for more than a year ((check)), they successfully escaped, and moved jurisdictions to now be a free man.


((make note about the benefits of closing things down. Repeated in biology (cells) & society (organisations). It's important to note that it's all about opportunity & marginal cost. If all costs were reduced to zero or near marginal, closing down becomes worst outcome. Substrate. Blockchain as trust commons? Empowering everything. Imbuing. Enclosure of the hardware commons?))

(this section atm is purely to write down some thoughts)
Some notes on how the commons disappeared. Mostly taken from Jeremy Rifkin's excellent Zero Marginal Cost Society.

Feudal economy = subsistence communication/energy matrix.  
Thousands of isolate localities.  
Feudal landlords leased their land to peasant farmers under tenancy agreements.  
Freeholders vs leaseholders (lasts about 3 lifetimes)  
Tenancy agreements = give me part of your harvest/till my fields as well/tax  
Peasants worked in commons (aggregated land)  
Land/property were God's creation -> the great chain of Being.  
property divvied up into sphere's of responsibility conforming to a fixed code of proprietary obligations.  
"no one had absolute lordship over land"  

Change came in Tudor England. Communal land enclosed to create private property. Exchane in marketplaces (through license of king, parliament or join agreement of village commons).  
Between 16th & early 19th centry.  
Peasants were uprooted -> labor power became available for hire.  

Feudal order was undermined by rising food prices (due to growth of urband population). Led to problems as land prices was fixed at pre-inflationary rates. Incipient textile industry -> more lucrative to close land & raise sheep instead.  

2nd wave of enclosures (1760 - 1840: first industrial revolution). More food demand -> more enclosures.  
Property rights went from conditional rights to exclusive ownership.  
People belonged to the land, now land belonged to individual people.  
One's word guaranteed trustworthiness of exchange before common law. Law had to evolve to allow private property exchange.  
Anonymous market where strangers are exchanging goods & services would not be possible without an enforceable legal code.
Requires police & courts.  

Rifkin's argument: print (communication) & wind (energy) led to market economy.  
Towns erected their own water mills, a competing source of power to the lord.  
First windmill in Europe -> Yorkshire, England 1185.  
Wind is everywhere, not bound to royal lands.  
Windmill become known as the "common'ers mill"  
Fulling mills -> more productive to raise sheep.  

Print removed subjective element. Stored memory and systemized retrieval of information.  
Print standardized maps.  
Print enabled contracts. Feudal economy relied on spoken word.  
Auditors spoke the financial information out loud to verify authenticity of the tx.  
Modern bookkeeping.  

"Free cities" - Serfs could escape to other jurisdictions.  
Guilds sprung up (defined by trade). Not full markets. A "just price".  
Merchants began to bypass guilds.  
Manufacturers banned together with merchants. -> national markets, free trade, lessen restrictions on labour mobility, enforcement of contracts, etc.  
Merchants aligned with monarchy on. Foreign over domestic trade.  
First voters were men of property.  

Then the next chapter goes into rise of capitalism (will decide whether to include or not.)
