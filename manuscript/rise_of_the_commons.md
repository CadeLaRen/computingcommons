Something is afoot. You are, probably. You are either standing, sitting or lying down as you read this sentence. For those attempting to defy gravity, you might also be flying, hanging or just floating about. 

In all these scenarios, there’s plenty of things taken for granted, for you to assume your chosen position. Standing on a floor. Sitting on a chair. Lying on a bed. Flying in a plane. Hanging from a bungee rope (for those times you just really want to read an article after you’ve flushed your body with adrenaline).

We trust the floor, chair, bed, plane & bungee rope (usually). We don’t generally question a chair’s capability to hold our weight. It’s no intervention at least. We have heuristics & an understanding of the world & its physics that allow to us to basically “forget” (from our perspective) those required internal mental processes.

It just works. This neat property of physics means we can build very tall buildings & float about in space stations. When we don’t have to trust the previous substrate to be obstreperous, we can generally assume that into the future things should be okay & we can build upon it.

From a social systems perspective, we’ve been building new foundations for aeons. We invent new systems that allow us to similarly “forget” the required internal mental processes to interact with each other. Everything we run to make the modern economy tick is built on things that were once new. Each time we invent a new substrate, we can forge ahead knowing we aren’t building on weak foundations: the chair isn’t made of paper.

Agriculture, Aqueducts, Steam Engines, Cars, Printing Presses, Double-entry accounting, Joint-stock Corporations, Cities & the Web. Countless inventions (big & small) that allowed us to push our social systems to grander scales.

Now we live in a globally connected world. Almost all adults have a smartphone ((check)) & products like Facebook have 1.55 billion monthly active users. It’s all unprecedented & we are moving further ahead. We are taking a new leap. We are globally connected, but we are still pretty much stuck with social systems from a pre-internet era. We are at the cusp of solidifying these grand new social systems of the new age. What new technology could take us further, allowing us to not just becoming a planetary society, but also eventually an interplanetary one?

If we take a look at history, and how we got here, it’s about continuously automating the internal social processes of society through technology. What would allow us to not rely on the crutches of national level systems: towards a society where we can trust others on a global scale? Or rather, where we don’t have to think if this chair is going to hold our weight? Where we don’t have to rely on figuring out if we can trust the chair or not? I can interact with anyone on Earth without having to rely on the mental processes to figure out if you aren’t going to abuse it.

Thankfully, there is such a technology that holds that promise: the blockchain.
