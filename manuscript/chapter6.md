# Decentralized Realities

"At first, I was quietly immersed. Then, I felt a tear well up, blurring the view. Then I was choking back sounds as my wife was next to me reading a book, not realizing I was feeling so overwhelmed. I was a person in a messy apartment in New Jersey, with a virtual reality headset on my weeping face, far removed from Jordan, or Syria." Donning Gear VR (a virtual realy head-mounted display), Scott Stein, writer at CNet, explained his experience being immersed in the "Clouds over Sidra" demo. It's a virtual reality experience that follows a quick walk through the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan for displaced Syrians.
