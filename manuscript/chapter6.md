# Decentralized Law

Collectively, we all agree to, that some people have the right to put others behind bars. We let this social construct exist, because collectively, we feel that the benefit outweighs the cost. We cede control to some unifying body to collectively allow us to create more "trustless" situations in our society. If I sign a lease for my apartment, I can eventually appeal to external actors (the law) if the contract was breached, and so recourse can occur if needed. If there wasn't any recourse possible, I had to incorporate trust into the agreement: I had to just know that this person won't in any attempt to breach the contract. In this case, it usually only occurs effectively if both parties have "skin in the game". For example, if it is your friend, they would not want to destroy the relationship and thus you work with each other just based on this verbal agreement/contract. If there is no skin in the game, then an appeal to an arbiter is usally desired. Currently this arbiter is usually the courts (and ultimately, the state). 

If there is a breach of contract, it is eventually taken to court. Eventually defying a court order, could eventually lead to incarceration. As such, the ultimate "arbiter" is force. For the most part, people voluntarily opt into this system, because even though force is eventually used to get a person into prison, it's an agreed upon social norm in various jurisdictions. In certain circumstances, we accept the potential fallbility of such a system: the potential for this authority to be misused, in return that we know that it is used ultimately for the "greater good". Over time, if this gets abused, a society can reach breaking point and revolt against this status quo, to once again make it fair. That's the hope at least.

As such, most agreements which require interacting beyond the established trust relationships we have, require a direct arbiter we both agree upon. This layer of arbiters eventually cascade up to the highest one: the law of the country. It's obviously a lot more complex than this. What is apparent from the current status quo that we choose to live with is that we accept force and violence to be the ultimate deterrers to staying with an agreement: it is punishment for defecting. Secondly, because of this, the use of arbiters gravitate towards a pyramid infrastructure. It is easier for us to have one police, than several.

Hypothetically, we could have a mutual friend be an arbiter in the case of a dispute, but the problem comes in when the issue at hand is greater than the friendship and then you are stuck with a scenario where the outcome was negative for everyone involved. There is/was no recourse.

## Code as Law

(polycentric law => BitNation)
(the rise of the mass arbiters)
(reputation systems?)
(removing the hardware, what then?)
