# Decentralized Law

Collectively, we all agree to, that some people have the right to put others behind bars. We let this social construct exist, because collectively, we feel that the benefit outweighs the cost. We cede control to some unifying body to collectively allow us to create more "trustless" situations in our society. If I sign a lease for my apartment, I can eventually appeal to external actors (the law) if the contract was breached, and so recourse can occur if needed. If there wasn't any recourse possible, I had to incorporate trust into the agreement: I had to just know that this person won't in any attempt to breach the contract. In this case, it usually only occurs effectively if both parties have "skin in the game". For example, if it is your friend, they would not want to destroy the relationship and thus you work with each other just based on this verbal agreement/contract. If there is no skin in the game, then an appeal to an arbiter is usally desired. Currently this arbiter is usually the courts (and ultimately, the state). 

If there is a breach of contract, it is eventually taken to court. Eventually defying a court order, could eventually lead to incarceration. As such, the ultimate "arbiter" is force. For the most part, people voluntarily opt into this system, because even though force is eventually used to get a person into prison, it's an agreed upon social norm in various jurisdictions. In certain circumstances, we accept the potential fallbility of such a system: the potential for this authority to be misused, in return that we know that it is used ultimately for the "greater good". Over time, if this gets abused, a society can reach breaking point and revolt against this status quo, to once again make it fair. That's the hope at least.

As such, most agreements which require interacting beyond the established trust relationships we have, require a direct arbiter we both agree upon. This layer of arbiters eventually cascade up to the highest one: the law of the country. It's obviously a lot more complex than this. What is apparent from the current status quo that we choose to live with is that we accept force and violence to be the ultimate deterrers to staying with an agreement: it is punishment for defecting. Secondly, because of this, the use of arbiters gravitate towards a pyramid infrastructure. It is easier for us to have one police, than several. It is Hobbes' Leviathan. As [Brett Scott](http://www.e-ir.info/2014/06/01/visions-of-a-techno-leviathan-the-politics-of-the-bitcoin-blockchain/) writes: "self-regarding people realise that it is in their interests to exchange part of their freedom for security of self and property, and thereby enter into a contract with a Sovereign, a deified personage that sets out societal rules of engagement."

Hypothetically, we could have a mutual friend be an arbiter in the case of a dispute, but the problem comes in when the issue at hand is greater than the friendship and then you are stuck with a scenario where the outcome was negative for everyone involved. There is/was no recourse.

## Code as Law

((quote about code is law)).

To a large extent, all the previous chapters explain ways in which a lot of the way we do things can be automated through blockchain technology: we can do finance, property, trade & create organisations without any intermediary. All through these processes we require law to enable them (when not using blockchain mediators). The use of Ricardian contracts in OpenBazaar (for trade). To create a company, we require legal documents to enforce shares & ownership structures. We rely on the state to keep record of land & property and appeal to them if it has been violated. It's because ultimately (and this is grossly oversimplified), we can't enforce things besides using paper (or databases these days) & people. Combining all these useful self-enforcing code will definitely lead to a lot of what law (especially civil law) is supposed to provide to society, meaningless. Law will be replace by code. Not all law will be, but a lot of it will. It will also provide empowerment & agency to a lot of people who can't necessarily have access to lawyers to create binding contracts.

## Smarts Contract as Law

When you have self-enforcing code that act as the mediators, it changes somewhat to the law we currently know. Nick Szabo, inventor of the term "smart contract", calls this difference "wet" vs "dry" code, referring to social & trust requirements as "wet" and "dry" as the self-enforcing algorithms. Quinn DuPont & Bill Maurer, writing about [blockchains & law](http://kingsreview.co.uk/magazine/blog/2015/06/23/ledgers-and-law-in-the-blockchain/) distinguishes how the current world of contracts require external factors to resolve them, compared to smart contracts which by design has to contain it. In other words, these self-enforcing contracts can remove all "wet" parts from contracts. If there is no code that allows for a dispute, it is not possible to have them. An "appeal" in a smart contract system can only work if the system is design to accomodate. For example, OpenBazaar's notary/arbiter system. Once the code is live, it is dumb and follows the rules that is coded for it.

## Mass arbiters

(the rise of the mass arbiters => a normal person has the power to enforce. Divorcining judgement & enforcement, separating it)
(polycentric law => BitNation)

## The Analog Gap

We can paint a future where access control is limited to cryptographic keys: you can only enter your home if you have that key. Or, you can only get into the self-driving electric car if you prove you bought 30min of time for it. For now

## Conclusion

Imagining a world where law is math, could actually paint a dystopian future. Primavera de Filippi argued this by asking if we are actually being faced with ["Freenet" or "Skynet"](https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/luncheon/2014/04/difilippi)? The act of trying to codify inherently "wet" contracts into "dry" ones, means you are losing complexities by abstracting it. A lot of contracts don't need much complexity, in which case, smart contracts serve to replace them and improve efficiency, but for a lot of scenarios, we might want variability/flexibility. This is especially the case when we consider how power structures have always evolved over time. Having the possibility to break a contract lead to revolutions, and to where we are today. A lot of the greatest stories told have been of pariahs breaking the shackles and leading change against adversity. If we use something as strong as cryptography and mathematics to govern ourselves, we could eventually be lead to a path where no dissent is ever possible, and that is indeed dystopian. As these things go, the future won't ever be as extreme to one side as we imagine. As Brett Scott affirms: "We do not want a future society free from people we have to trust, or one in which the most we can hope for is privacy. Rather, we want a world in which technology is used to dilute the power of those systems that cause us to doubt trust relationships." Smart contracts can promise that.
