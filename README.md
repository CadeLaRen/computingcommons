# The Blockchain: Mapping a decentralized future.
(Tentative title).

After 3 years of waking up each day, excited to read news about blockchain technology, I've decided to write a book about it. It details the use of it in various fields, getting more and more futuristic as the book progresses: starting at decentralized finance to building a framework for verifiably shared experiences using the blockchain in virtual reality.

## Intended Audience.

The book is intended for people who've just heard about Bitcoin and the blockchain, and wonders what it can "really" do. I'll try my best to explain complex parts as simple as possible. I won't go too deep into the technical side of things (such as explaining how a Slasher consensus algorithm works). A future book will be more technical (thinking of doing a book on all the consensus algorithms). The purpose is to enthuse, excite and explore the possibilities. I have several reasons why I'm writing this, and my biggest goal is, that if done properly, I would like this book to become the de facto recommendation when people want to understand why the blockchain is one of the biggest inventions in history.

## Leanpub.

During the writing proces, [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/theblockchain) will be used. Once done, I will make the book available to be bought in Bitcoin (and probably any other reasonably traded altcoin out there). I will also be selling the book on OpenBazaar at a discount. Pre-sale + launch price will be $9.99, after which it will be $15 from there on onwards.

## Planned sections

The rough outline of the book will follow an exploration of blockchain tech, building upon previous chapters and getting more interesting and complex as it progresses. There's a lot of overlap, so it might change. Here's the current planned progress:

Introduction (What is Bitcoin/Blockchain)  
Decentralized Finance (BTC, Multi-sig, Payment channels, etc)  
Decentralized Property (Colored coins, Smart property, Namecoin, DNSChain, Proof of existence, etc)  
Decentralized Marketplaces (Chapter almost specifically on OpenBazaar and its possibilities)  
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (Ethereum, Appcoins, Republic of DOUG, deodands, etc)  
Decentralized AI & Agents (Simple agents to complex ones. From random darknet shopper to decentralized sensing as a service AI)  
Decentralized Law ("state as a service", opt-in consumer protected smart contracts, proof of sacrifice, passports, etc) //a lot of this might already have been covered in other chapters, so will see about this one.  
Decentralized Virtual Reality (Blockchain as consensus backbone for metaverses, Engi)  
The Adjacent Possible (conclusions)  

## Contributions.

I'm writing this book in the open, following the [lean publishing manifesto](https://leanpub.com/manifesto). Any contributions are welcome. I won't promise that they will be included, but will consider all changes! All contributors will get an honorable mention in the book. If anyone wants to contribute the front-page design of the book, please get in contact!
