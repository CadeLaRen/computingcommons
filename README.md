# The Computing Commons:
## Imagining the future of society empowered through blockchain technology.

The blockchain: it is the smart, distributed ledger that allows any participant to come to consensus on the state of information without requiring an intermediary. It’s been called “consensus computers” & “trust machines”. They come in many forms (Bitcoin, Ethereum & private ones). Whatever platform succeeds (one or many) will leave society with a vast, distributed, public computer. It’s memory will be our shared, unchangeable historical record, and its power will allow us to forge new relationships with each other and with our technology. It is giving rise to the computing commons.

This book extends onwards from the previous book I was writing about the blockchain (which can be found in the “old” folder, still available to read). The narrative has changed into a much grander vision. The blockchain is the tool. For each overarching theme, a long-form Medium post will be published. Each chapter will also be published as a $2 e-book. Once each theme is done, the whole book will be edited & revised into a full e-book.

## Leanpub.

During the writing proces, [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/theblockchain) will be used. The whole WIP book is currently being sold at the price of $9.99.

## Themes.

The themes are subject to change, but will currently cover the following:

Blockchains & The Rise of a Computing Commons (intro & context)

Infinite Scarcity (assigning value to all networks & management of global capital)

The Information Markets   
(A chapter solely on prediction markets. What happens if we allow censorship-resistant betting on everything? Could we model externalities? Would we recreate a map of reality in the digital?)

Lex Cryptographia   
(What happens if you have cryptography enforcing contracts? Smart property? Appeal to authority disappears only for very rare scenarios?)

The Agents: A Language For Programs

Transcension   
(Could we model state logic of an alternate reality on a blockchain? Will it provide cascading empathy if other realities are better than the current one? VR & Blockchains?)

The Empathy Machines  
(Conclusion)

## Contributions.

I'm writing this in the open, following the [lean publishing manifesto](https://leanpub.com/manifesto). Any contributions are welcome. I won't promise that they will be included, but I will consider all changes! All contributors will (at least) get an honourable mention.
