# The Blockchain: Mapping the decentralized future.

After 3 years of waking up each day excited to read news about blockchain technology, I've decided to write a book about it. It details the use of the blockchain in various fields, getting more and more futuristic as the book progresses from decentralized finance, to building a framework for verifiably shared experiences using the blockchain in virtual reality.

## Intended Audience.

The book is intended for people who've just heard about Bitcoin and the blockchain, and wonder what it can "really" do. I'll try my best to explain complex parts as simply as possible. I won't delve too deeply into the technical side of things (such as explaining how a Slasher consensus algorithm works). A planned future book will be more technical (possibly exploring all the consensus algorithms). The purpose of this book is to enthuse, excite and explore the possibilities. I have several reasons for writing this; my biggest goal is that, if done properly, this book becomes the de facto recommendation for people wanting to understand why the blockchain is one of the biggest inventions in history.

## Leanpub.

During the writing proces, [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/theblockchain) will be used. Once done, I will make the book available to be bought in Bitcoin (and probably any other reasonably traded altcoin out there). I will also be selling the book on OpenBazaar at a discount. Pre-sale + launch price will be $9.99, after which the price will be $15 from then onwards.

## Planned sections

The rough outline of the book will follow an exploration of blockchain tech, building upon previous chapters and getting more interesting and complex as it progresses. There's a lot of overlap, so it might change. Here's the current planned progress:

(draft done) Introduction (What is Bitcoin/Blockchain)  
(draft done) Decentralized Finance
(draft done) Decentralized Property
(draft done) Decentralized Trade (Chapter almost specifically on OpenBazaar and its possibilities).
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (Ethereum, Appcoins, Republic of DOUG, deodands, etc)  
(draft done) Decentralized AI & Agents (Simple agents to complex ones. From random darknet shopper to decentralized sensing as a service AI)  
Decentralized Law ("state as a service", opt-in consumer protected smart contracts, proof of sacrifice, passports, etc)  
(draft done) Decentralized Alternate Reality (Blockchain as consensus backbone for metaverses, Engi)  
The Adjacent Possible (conclusions)  

## Contributions.

I'm writing this book in the open, following the [lean publishing manifesto](https://leanpub.com/manifesto). Any contributions are welcome. I won't promise that they will be included, but I will consider all changes! All contributors will get an honorable mention in the book. If anyone wants to contribute the front-page design of the book, please get in contact!
